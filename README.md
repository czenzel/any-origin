Any Origin - Simple CORS

This web site runs an implementation of a custom CORS script, or a script to allow users to create cross-domain requests on the Internet, using programming technologies such as Javascript and/or jQuery.

Currently this script is in development, but is being offered to users who are willing to mirror the script on their own web site, server data centers, and/or their own hosting platform to provide performance and cross-domain query requests across the world.

Any Origin Updates
===

September 6th, 2014 - This update now includes several bug fixes that were finalized in addition to a server-side caching version of the script.

June 29th, 2014 - This update now includes the ability for post in addition to get data. This build does not yet pass any cookies. It is recommended that you do not transmit secure information through this as with any Internet script. This build also includes the standard rejection for clients not using standard CORS technology to prevent mirrors from overloading.

May 2014 - The starting script was built.
